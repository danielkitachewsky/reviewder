- include example reviews (branch "examples") in a testing folder to have them as unit tests, but make sure they're not packaged in the public version
- replace color-code of type by icons. Once it's done color-code review rating (red for below, green for outstanding)
- place a visual marker for the one-year mark (also see if that makes sense for other time-related things, i.e. team leader reco, certs, supplemental activities)
- make sure we can be cleanly interrupted by Ctrl+C, even in the middle of downloads
- retrieve screen name of candidate by DCI number (use the people tab?). Use it for file name and title of page
- handle DCI password error
- check that printing works and possibly make a print-only CSS
