- make sure we can be cleanly interrupted by Ctrl+C, even in the middle of downloads
- retrieve screen name of candidate by DCI number (use the people tab?). Use it for file name and title of page
- handle DCI password error
- filter by date

- fix appearance of icons on Retina displays (they're much too small)
- bug in progress bar when the text doesn't fit in the terminal's width (doesn't erase everything)
- test with reviews by Emeritus
